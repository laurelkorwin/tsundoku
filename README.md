# tsundoku

<b> PROJECT DESCRIPTION </b>

Tsundoku is a visually-engaging content-sharing app for books. It allows users to search for books (using the Amazon Product Advertising API, parsing search results with the Amazon Product Python wrapper and lxml) and save books to user-specific "boards" for categorization. 

Users can mark books as "read" or "to read", rate books they've read, and write notes on books they've saved. They can also add friends on the app, view their friend's boards, and share specific book recommendations with friends. 

Finally, users can also view their own "book profile" - a data visualization of books they've read and enjoyed, as well as friend & recommendation statistics.
